The file From_a_univ_with_paths.tex is derived from the three versions of the
file found among Voevodsky's files after his death.  The file is modified to
get it to compile and to use his bibtex file, alggeom.bib.  The first three
github commits correspond to the three versions of the file, and subsequent
commits correspond to attempts by Grayson to take the referee's comments into
account.  The "make" target "diff" in the Makefile will show the differences
with the appropriate one of Voevodsky's original files.

In the commit messages, we use the verb "address" to indicate that we address a
problem identified by the referee.
